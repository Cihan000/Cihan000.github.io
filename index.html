            <p>
                I like to play basketball, video games, hang around with friends, watch sports, and lift weights. 
                I was born and raised in Turkey and finished high school there. 
                Now I'm in my second year in Canada, studying Computer Programming and Analysis.

            <p>
                I don't have any background in programming, but I'm eager to learn and improve my skills every day. 
                My goal is to become confident in coding and eventually work on creative software projects.
            </p>
